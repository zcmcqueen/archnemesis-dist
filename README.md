__________

ArchNEMESIS is an open-source Python package developed for the analysis of remote sensing spectroscopic observations of planetary atmospheres. 
It is based on the widely used NEMESIS (Non-linear Optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral analySIS) radiative transfer and retrieval tool, 
which has been extensively used for the investigation of a wide variety of planetary environments.

ArchNEMESIS is currently maintained by [Juan Alday](https://research.open.ac.uk/people/ja22256) and [Joseph Penn](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/penn).
The [NEMESIS](https://nemesiscode.github.io/index.html) algorithm, code archNEMESIS is based on, was originally developed by [Patrick Irwin](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/irwin).

## Documentation
For full documentation, visit [archnemesis.readthedocs.io](https://archnemesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Installation

The latest version of code has to be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/juanaldayparejo/archnemesis-dist.git) under a [GNU General Public License v3](LICENSE). To do so, type in the command window:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juanaldayparejo/archnemesis-dist.git
```

Then, we need to get into the package folder using:

```bash
   cd archnemesis-dist
```

Finally, we need to install the library. Given that archNEMESIS is a highly dynamic package were new additions are frequently introduced, we recommend installing the package but keeping it editable by typing:

```bash
   pip install --editable .
```

This will install archNEMESIS, but with the ability to update any changes made to the code (e.g., when introducing new model parameterisations or methods). In addition, it will install all the required libraries archNEMESIS depends on.
