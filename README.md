__________

ArchNEMESIS is an open-source Python package developed for the analysis of remote sensing spectroscopic observations of planetary atmospheres. 
It is based on the widely used NEMESIS (Non-linear Optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral analySIS) radiative transfer and retrieval tool, 
which has been extensively used for the investigation of a wide variety of planetary environments.

ArchNEMESIS is currently maintained by [Juan Alday](https://research.open.ac.uk/people/ja22256) and [Joseph Penn](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/penn).
The [NEMESIS](https://nemesiscode.github.io/index.html) algorithm, code archNEMESIS is based on, was originally developed by [Patrick Irwin](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/irwin).

If interested users are missing key points in the documentation, would appreciate seeing jupyter notebooks for certain purposes, or want to report issues, please do so by contacting us or joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Te43qbrVFK) channel.


## Documentation
For full documentation, visit [archnemesis.readthedocs.io](https://archnemesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Installation

There are three main ways to install **archNEMESIS**, depending on your use case:

### Installing from GitHub (developer mode)

The latest version of code has to be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/juanaldayparejo/archnemesis-dist.git) under a [GNU General Public License v3](LICENSE). To do so, type in the command window:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juanaldayparejo/archnemesis-dist.git
```

Before installing archNEMESIS, we recommend users to create and load a new Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for a clean install:

```bash
python -m venv name_of_virtual_environment/
source name_of_virtual_environment/bin/activate
```

Then move into the package directory:

```bash
cd archnemesis-dist
```

Finally, we need to install the library. Given that archNEMESIS is a highly dynamic package were new additions are frequently introduced, we recommend installing the package but keeping it editable by typing:

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

This will install archNEMESIS, but with the ability to update any changes made to the code (e.g., when introducing new model parameterisations or methods). In addition, it will install all the required libraries archNEMESIS depends on.


### Installing from PyPI

The simplest way to install archNEMESIS is via PyPI.  
We recommend doing this inside a clean Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv archnemesis-env
source archnemesis-env/bin/activate
pip install archnemesis
```

This will install the latest stable release of the package along with its dependencies.
It is the recommended method if you just want to use the library without editing the source code.

## Downloading archNEMESIS spectroscopic databases

Several features of archNEMESIS, including the calculation of absorption cross sections and correlated-*k* coefficients, rely on spectroscopic line parameters from databases such as HITRAN, HITEMP, GEISA, and ExoMol. To perform these calculations, the spectroscopic line data must be stored in the archNEMESIS database format.

Reference spectroscopic databases compatible with archNEMESIS are available from our dedicated collection on DIGITAL.CSIC:

         width="250">
</a>

Users wishing to work with spectroscopic databases that are not included in this collection can generate their own archNEMESIS-formatted databases. If you require assistance with this process, please contact us.
