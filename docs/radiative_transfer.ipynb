    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The NEMESIS code is able to model the electromagnetic spectrum of different planetary atmospheres under different observing geometries (e.g., nadir-viewing, limb-viewing, solar occultations, exoplanet phase curves, etc.). In order to generate the spectra, NEMESIS reads the required information from input files, performs the calculations, and writes the outputs into other files. The structure of NemesisPy, shown in the Figure below, is equivalent to that of NEMESIS: 1) The information from the input files is stored into classes, which are later carried through the code. 2) The reference classes, together with the specific model parameterisations that want to be tested, feed the required information into the Forward Model class, which is in charge of performing the radiative transfer calculations and modelling the spectra. 3) The modelled spectra are then written into output files.\n",

    "In order to model the atmosphere of different planets, NEMESIS uses an ID number for each of these, and searches some important parameters (e.g., size and mass) to compute the gravitational field at different altitudes and latitudes.

    "\n",
    "Apart from the gaseous species, the atmosphere is also represented by a set of aerosol vertical profiles.

This particular file can be read/write using the *read_aerosol()* and *write_aerosol()* functions in the Atmosphere class (see Examples). The units of the aerosol vertical profiles in the *aerosol.ref* are m$^{-2}$.

    "At this stage, NemesisPy does not include routines to calculate the cross sections from line databases. These must be calculated using the programs from the Fortran version of NEMESIS. However, NemesisPy includes a set of routines in the Spectroscopy class to read these tables (see Examples). It must be noted that the cross sections stored in the pre-tabulated tables are multiplied by a factor of 10$^{20}$, and must be corrected by the user to get the correct values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Collision-Induced Absorption (CIA) refers to to spectral features generated by inelastic collisions of molecules in a gas. CIA is particularly important in dense gases, and it must be accounted for to model the electromagnetic spectrum of planetary atmospheres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIA cross sections are stored in pre-tabulated tables expected to be in *Data/cia*. The standard format of these tables changes between NEMESIS (Fortran) and NemesisPy, but the calculations themselves are equivalent. In particular, the Fortran version of NEMESIS stores the cross sections in a binary file for a pre-defined set of pairs (H$_2$-H$_2$ (equilibrium); H$_2$-He (equilibrium); H$_2$-H$_2$ (normal); H$_2$-He (normal); H$_2$-N$_2$, N$_2$-CH$_4$, N$_2$-N$_2$, CH$_4$-CH$_4$, H$_2$-CH$_4$). Instead, the format of the CIA tables in NemesisPy is written in an HDF5 file and the calculations will be performed with as many pairs as it is defined in the CIA table (i.e., the pairs are defined arbitrarily by selecting the IDs of the different gases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between the CIA tables in both versions is that the Fortran version defines the CIA cross sections in the pre-tabulated table in cm$^{-1}$ amagat$^{-2}$. Instead, the CIA cross sections tabulated in the HDF5 file are tabulated in cm$^{5}$ molecule$^{-2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in functions of the CIA class in NemesisPy can be used to read the CIA tables in any of the two formats, and automatically takes into account the change of units from cm$^{-1}$ amagat$^{-2}$ to cm$^{5}$ molecule$^{-2}$.\n",

    "Scattering is the phenomenon by which light photons get deviated from their straight path on striking an obstacle like aerosols or gas molecules in the atmosphere.

    "- Phase function, which defines the direction of the scattered photons.\n",

In particular, the Mie calculations are performed using the *miescat* function of the Scatter class (see Examples).\n",

    "NEMESIS can simultaneously model spectra made with *NGEOM* different observational geometries. For a given geometry, it might be the case that a number of sub-geometries need to be defined to accurately represent the field-of-view of the instrument, which will later be averaged to compute one single spectrum. This number of sub-geometries is defined by *NAV* (i.e., number of averaging points), and the weight of each sub-geometry is defined by *WGEOM*. For each sub-geometry (even if there is just one sub-geometry *NAV* = 1), a number of parameters need to be defined:\n",

    "A spectral measurement in the *.spx* file is defined by indicating the wavelength points (*VCONV*), the measured spectrum (*MEAS*) and the corresponding uncertainty (*ERRMEAS*).

For each convolution wavelength (*VCONV*), then the instrument function is defined independently by defining a finer grid of wavelengths (*VFIL*) with the corresponding values of the filter function (*AFIL*). The *.fil* can be easily read/write using the *read_fil()* and *write_fil()* functions of the Measurement class.\n",

Each of these atmospheric layers will have its own properties (e.g., pressure, temperature, vertical column density, etc.), providing a realistic representation of the atmosphere along the measurement path. Ideally, the atmosphere would be split into an infinite number of layers, although such approach is not possible in radiative transfer models. Instead, NEMESIS allows to divide the atmosphere into *NLAY* layers, which can be split different approaches to mitigate any biases arising from the finite representation of the atmospheric layers.

This is especially important for retrievals, when these parameters are modified in each iteration to find the best fit between the modelled and measured spectra.

    "   - Variables.SA : This field represents the a priori covariance matrix and must be filled accordingly based on the parameters stored on the *.apr* file.\n",
    "   - Variables.LX : This field tells whether a particular element of the state vector is carried in log-scale.\n",
